[Merithon](https://www.runtobeer.ca/merithon-2022) if my third fun run in a row, after the 5k Foam Fest, and The Runway. These runs are awesome, entertaining, different. They have an exclusive formula, out of the conventional 5, 10, 21, and 42km. In case of Merithon, we set a group of runners to run from Toronto to Hamilton, where the Merit Brewery is located. It works like a relay, where each runner covers a section of the 70km distance. The course doesn't need to be equally divided among runners. Each one runs the distance they can deliver their best for the team. Some run shorter distances, other longer distances, giving a lot of room for strategies.

I had the chance to lower my half-marathon personal best by 2 minutes. My previous time was 1h52, measured during my [first marathon](/sports/2018/10/first-marathon.html). My new time is now 1h50, measured four years later.
