![Started Running](/sports/images/posts/started-running.jpg)

Belgium, summer of 2017, I was 6 months into swimming, the sport of my youth, to escape from an obesity trend that was already causing issues like breaking the toilette seat, snoring to the point my wife was having trouble to sleep, expending extra money with food I didn't need to eat, and so on. I was slowly getting in shape, happy with the training, when they told me there will be a summer break, with classes paused for two months and resuming in September. "I can't stop!!!"

I was in panic, I knew all the weight lost would come back shortly. Coincidence or not, I was chatting with a colleague during one of our working breaks when he mentioned a running group from the local sport complex that gathers twice a week. I thought that would be a way to stay in shape while I waited for the swimming classes to resume.

I wasn't sure I could complete an hour running. I never did that, so the first day was giving me chills. As a group, we left the sport complex following our coach through the streets and trails of the city. We are running while talking, listening to nature, horns, dogs, water streams, talking and thinking about everything but running. That hour passed so fast that I didn't even feel tired. I felt amazed instead. It was like discovering a power I didn't know I had.

The excitement didn't last longer. The day after I was sore, limping and feeling every joint. I discovered later that was my first lactate threshold crossing, a natural limit that would take some time to push further. To make things harder, the second workout of the week was internal training and I had to run much harder than the first time. I had to push close to my limit during a short period to recover in another short period of time. All my optimism was hit by reality.
