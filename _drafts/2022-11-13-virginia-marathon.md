I was coming from a very disappointing Toronto Waterfront Marathon, with lots of lessons learned, anxious for another race to put in check my new experiences. The Virginia Marathon was the next in the agenda, but would it be the one to test my knowledge?

Certainly not the one to chase a personal best. It is organized on the country side, in the charming wineries of Virginia. The route is unpaved and irregular, but not too technical. The gravel and the dirt already drags a lot, but almost 1000m of elevation drags even more. The competitive spirit is always there, but in a fun race, the only time we can beat would be the one from the same race in a previous edition, which I had none, so it was really about having fun.

Why running a marathon in such remote place? We were just trying to find an excuse to visit relatives in the US. After travelling to so many races, running became a must-do attraction everywhere we go these days. That's why we started our planning asking the following question: "Is there a race happening soon, close to where they live?". A big plus for this races was its trail characteristics, surrounded by trees, farms, birds, and locals. Nature always distract our minds from fatigue.

The race day was uncomfortably cold, making me still afraid to be overdressed, which causes excessive sweating. Fortunately, I had family around to leave my top layer with them and start with just two layers. To my astonishment, the elevations started right away, with a long downhill (which also mean a tough finishing) and multiple ups and downs, like long waves. My body was warm in less than 2k, which turned my warning sign on. I decided to slow down and enjoy the view. Since the beginning, my goal was simply finishing the race while running all the time. Some runners passed me and for the first time I was OK with that. The number of viewers in the course was surprisingly high to a race in the middle of nowhere. But what was most amazing was to get more from other fellow runners than from viewers.

I felt strong through the whole race, even passing those who passed me at the beginning. The tricky part was a 10k straight uphill, from 20k to 30k. In fact, there were ups and downs through the whole track and my strategy was to slow down when going up and let gravity push me when going down.

The day before, we had Japanese food for dinner, instead of pasta. It is rich in carbohydrates from rice and sodium from seasoning. Since I lose a lot of sodium through sweating, this food is my pre-race choice these days. During the race I was drinking mostly isotonics and rarely water and felt great all the time. Despite the fatigue at the end, it was nowhere near the wall I hit in Toronto, being able to finish strong and even together with my son, who was also finishing his 5k at the same time. What a special moment!

Overall, the race was great! Well organized, beautiful view, kind people, supportive runners, and excited for finishing one more marathon feeling so strong. I can't recommend enough. Sure I will come back one day.
