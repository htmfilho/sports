## Pre-race

- Pass the sunscreen way in advance, so it has time to dry before putting on my racewear.
- Bring sandals to wear after dropping my shoes at the transition. The path to the swimming area might be hot or gravel.
- If allowed, wear a wet suit. It enables you to glide and float more, which translates into more speed.
- Warm up my body with active dry-land before entering the water. It helps to resist the water temperature and allows me to sprint at the start.

## Swim

- Start the race sprinting for at least 200m to distance myself from the slow crowd. They produce waves that make breathing harder, affecting my cadence and technique.
- After finding some space to myself, focus more on stretching and good technique to glide more and save energy.
- If possible, find someone with reliable swimming, at my pace, to track from behind and slightly to the side (draft is illegal). This way I don't need to check for directions as often.
- Swim backstroke to turn left or right in the turning floaters.
- When the finish line is finally visible, sprint to it, using the remaining energy in your arms, which will not be demanded as much anymore.
- In the water, swimming is more efficient than walking, so try to swim until you can't stroke anymore, instead of walking when it's possible to reach the bottom.
- While running to the transition, visualize myself doing the transition, going through all the steps in my head.

## Transition to Bike

- Wear the helmet and make sure it is well attached and tight.
- Wear the sunglasses.
- My bike doesn't clip the shoes, so wear socks and running shoes instead. It will be slightly less efficient, but it will make the transition to running faster.
- Put the nutrition in my pockets.
- Remove the bike from the hack and run with it until passing the start line.

## Bike

- Mount the bike and go, but move slowly at the beginning.
- Eat two nutrition sachets, one to replenish from the swimming and another one for the kilometers ahead. Drink a quarter of the water. bottle to dilute the nutrition, smoothing the digestion.
- Gradually increase the speed to a pace I can sustain for longer.
- Take a sip of water every time I feel my mouth dry.
- Take a nutrition sachet every 30 minutes, followed by water.
- If riding against the wind, lean my upper body as much as possible.

## Transition to Run

- Attach the bike to the rack.
- Remove the helmet.
- Attach the bib belt.
- Recharge the nutrition in my pockets.
- Keep the sunglasses and the running shoes and go!

## Run

- Start slow and take one nutrition sachet.
- Gradually increase the pace after 3k.
- Take a nutrition sachet before every other water station.
- Sprint as soon as I spot the finish line.
