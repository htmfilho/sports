## Pre-race

1. First of all, I need to charge my Garmin watch.
2. Run a 5k distance the day before to activate the gut. It reduces the chances of needing a washroom during the race.
3. Pass the sunscreen in advance, so it has time to dry before putting on my racewear.
4. Bring the tire's pump.
5. Bring sandals to wear after dropping my shoes at the transition. The path to the swimming area might be hot or gravel.
6. Fill my water bottle with a hydration drink.
7. Ride the bike for a few minutes to check if everything is good to go or if something needs to be fixed.
8. At the transition area:
   - Attach the bike to the rack.
   - Put the helmet on top of the bike seat to remind myself to put it on before getting the bike off the hack.
   - Organize the equipment below the bike, over a towel, separated by transitioning to bike and running.
9. If allowed, wear a wet suit. It enables me to glide and float more, translating into more speed.
10. Warm up my body with active dry-land before entering the water. It helps to resist the water temperature and allows me to sprint at the start.

## Swim

1. Start the race sprinting for at least 200m to distance myself from the slow crowd. They produce waves that make breathing harder, affecting my cadence and technique.
2. After finding some space, I focus more on stretching and good technique to glide more and save energy.
3. If possible, find someone who looks reliable at swimming, at my pace, to track from behind and slightly to the side (draft is illegal). This way, I don't need to check for directions as often.
4. Swim backstroke to turn left or right in the turning buoys. I also swim backstroke when tired to get access to all the air I need, and recover while efficiently moving forward.
5. When the finish line is finally visible, sprint to it, using the remaining energy in your arms, which will not be demanded as much anymore.
6. In the water, swimming is more efficient than walking, so try to swim until you can't stroke anymore, instead of walking when it's possible to reach the bottom.
7. While running to the transition:
   - Remove the cap and the goggles.
   - If wearing a wet suit, remove it down to my waist and keep running to the bike with the legs covered.
   - Visualize myself doing the transition, going through all the steps in my head.

## Transition to Bike

1. If wearing a wet suit, remove the remaining part.
2. Wear the helmet and make sure it is well attached and tight.
3. Put on the helmet.
4. Put on the sunglasses.
5. My bike doesn't clip the shoes, so I put socks on and running shoes instead. It will be slightly less efficient, but it makes the transition to running faster.
6. Put the nutrition in my pockets.
7. Remove the bike from the hack and run with it until passing the start line.

## Bike

1. Mount the bike and go, but move slowly at the beginning.
2. Eat two nutrition sachets, one to replenish from the swimming and another one for the distance ahead. Drink a quarter of the water bottle to dilute the nutrition, smoothing the digestion.
3. Gradually increase the speed to a pace I can sustain for longer.
4. Take a sip of water every time I feel my mouth dry.
5. Take a nutrition sachet every 30 minutes, followed by water.
6. If riding against the wind, lean my upper body as much as possible in an aero position.

## Transition to Run

1. Attach the bike to the rack.
2. Remove the helmet.
3. Put on a cap.
4. Attach the bib belt.
5. Recharge the nutrition in my pockets.
6. Keep the sunglasses and the running shoes and go!

## Run

1. Start slow and take one nutrition sachet.
2. Gradually increase the pace after 3k.
3. Take a nutrition sachet before every other water station.
4. Sprint as soon as I spot the finish line.
