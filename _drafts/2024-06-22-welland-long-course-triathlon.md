The idea of doing a Triathlon never crossed my mind until the winter of 2023, when a friend approached me and asked, "Let's do an IronMan?!". I replied with the only answer I knew, "Yes!" barely knowing what it was about. The days that followed were all excitement, trying to learn everything about this triathlon format and how to prepare for it. The idea quickly propagated through my family, and everybody got hooked on it too. However, we needed to be patient because we were at least six months away from any triathlon activity. Fortunately, time passed quickly, and here I am, telling the story of my first triathlon.

## Swimming

Even if the open water swim has some visual signs that helps with orientation, trust the training and do a frontal view every 7 strokes. We swam in a facility that is also used for canoeing races. They installed cables under water to support the race lanes. I used those cables for orientation so I could focus on the swim. However, the cable suddenly disappeared and I continued swimming, hoping to find it again, but I went way off the course. I think I had to swim 25m more to correct the course. Everything else went well, even the messy start. One last note about the swimming is how mush speed you gain wearing a wet suit. At the start, while I was constantly moving to float, those with wet suits looked more relaxed. During the swim, many were fast, even without a proper swimming technique. So, I absolutely need to buy a wet suit.

# Biking

The transition to biking was good, but I made a mistake that worried me throughout the entire ride: I forgot to attach my bib number. I had it written with a Sharpee on my two arms, but it would be difficult to see while in movement. So, I was afraid of being dequalified. But the ride was awesome anyway! The course was flat, well-marked, and scenic, passing through Ontario's farmlands. I managed to sustain an average speed of ~32km/h, rolling 30km/h with headwind and 34km/h with tailwind. The best part was to surpass really expensive bikes with my 15 hundred entry-level road bike, without clip pedals. At the end of the day, the real engine is within our legs.

A decision that had a later impact was to bring a single water bottle. It was empty around the 30km mark and the water station was at the 40km mark. My mouth got dry during that 10km water intake gap. In the water station, I dropped my empty bottle and got a full one, but the one I dropped was a real bike bottle and the one I got was a simple water bottle. Next time, I will just bring a disposable Gatorade-like bottle. By the 50km mark, my butt and my balls were hurting a lot. To alleviate the pain, I had to stand for a few seconds before sitting again, but the pain was coming back 2 minutes later. It felt like my circulation was blocked by my seat and my blood flow resumed after standing up. I don't know what it was, but people have advised me to train more and see if it passes over time.

## Running

The transition to running was weird. When I unmounted the bike my legs were loose. I would had fall if it wasn't for my running shoes giving me stability. The athletes around me were walking because of the terrain and I could run to my spot in the hack. During a grueling effort, I become a complete idiot. In a long distance run, it is Ok because there is not much to reason about, but triathlon is also a mental exercise. After hanging the bike, I didn't take enough liquid neither nutrition with me. I basically put my cap, a ton of sunscreen and ran away. I planned to run slow at the beginning and I felt I was slow, but my watch was showing the contrary. How is it possible? Instead of trusting my watch and reduce my pace, I took one more stupid decision and ignored it. Sustaining that pace broke me at the 7km mark and I decided to walk to put my heart back into the aerobic zone. I walked for 3 hundred meter and then jogged slowly, trying to reset the run. It worked for a while, but the heat of 33Â°C was relentless. The sun was burning my skin, water intake was never enough, to a point I was afraid to faint. Fortunately, the race was well organized and they never ran out of water, sport drinks, ice, wet towels, banana, and watermelon. Since I was profusely sweating, I took advantage of all that, but two things made a huge difference: ice and watermelon. I took a hand full of ice and put some under my cap and the rest under my trisuit. What a relief! Watermelon is known for increasing endurance because it hydrates but also improves blood flow and oxygen uptake. After a few minutes I was already feeling better. I managed to run the rest of the course slowly, but fast enough to complete the entire race in 4 hours.

## Takeaways

1. I have to learn to balance my effort better across the modalities. Maybe the running would have been better if I had started slowly and improved the pace gradually. Unfortunately, I have to wait an entire year to race another long-course triathlon to test a new strategy.

2. I'm not ready to race a longer triathlon than this one yet. I feel good about my swimming, but I have to train cycling way more to deal with my sitting discomfort and improve my effort balance and race strategy. But could I finish a longer triathlon today? Of course! But not without suffering too much.

3. The experience was great, and I'm definitely into triathlon. It unites in a single event two of my favourite sports, swimming and running, despite the high cost of cycling.

## Checklist for the Next Triathlon

### Pre-race

1. First of all, I need to charge my Garmin watch.
2. Run a 5k distance the day before to activate the gut. It reduces the chances of needing a washroom during the race.
3. Pass the sunscreen in advance, so it has time to dry before putting on my racewear.
4. Bring the tire's pump.
5. Bring sandals to wear after dropping my shoes at the transition. The path to the swimming area might be hot or gravel.
6. Fill my water bottle with a hydration drink.
7. Ride the bike for a few minutes to check if everything is good to go or if something needs to be fixed.
8. At the transition area:
   - Attach the bike to the rack.
   - Put the helmet on top of the bike seat to remind myself to put it on before getting the bike off the hack.
   - Organize the equipment below the bike, over a towel, separated by transitioning to bike and running.
9. If allowed, wear a wet suit. It enables me to glide and float more, translating into more speed.
10. Warm up my body with active dry-land before entering the water. It helps to resist the water temperature and allows me to sprint at the start.

### Swim

1. Start the race sprinting for at least 200m to distance myself from the slow crowd. They produce waves that make breathing harder, affecting my cadence and technique.
2. After finding some space, I focus more on stretching and good technique to glide more and save energy.
3. If possible, find someone who looks reliable at swimming, at my pace, to track from behind and slightly to the side (draft is illegal). This way, I don't need to check for directions as often.
4. Swim backstroke to turn left or right in the turning buoys. I also swim backstroke when tired to get access to all the air I need, and recover while efficiently moving forward.
5. When the finish line is finally visible, sprint to it, using the remaining energy in your arms, which will not be demanded as much anymore.
6. In the water, swimming is more efficient than walking, so try to swim until you can't stroke anymore, instead of walking when it's possible to reach the bottom.
7. While running to the transition:
   - Remove the cap and the goggles.
   - If wearing a wet suit, remove it down to my waist and keep running to the bike with the legs covered.
   - Visualize myself doing the transition, going through all the steps in my head.

### Transition to Bike

1. If wearing a wet suit, remove the remaining part.
2. Wear the helmet and make sure it is well attached and tight.
3. Put on the helmet.
4. Put on the sunglasses.
5. My bike doesn't clip the shoes, so I put socks on and running shoes instead. It will be slightly less efficient, but it makes the transition to running faster.
6. Put the nutrition in my pockets.
7. Remove the bike from the hack and run with it until passing the start line.

### Bike

1. Mount the bike and go, but move slowly at the beginning.
2. Eat two nutrition sachets, one to replenish from the swimming and another one for the distance ahead. Drink a quarter of the water bottle to dilute the nutrition, smoothing the digestion.
3. Gradually increase the speed to a pace I can sustain for longer.
4. Take a sip of water every time I feel my mouth dry.
5. Take a nutrition sachet every 30 minutes, followed by water.
6. If riding against the wind, lean my upper body as much as possible in an aero position.

### Transition to Run

1. Attach the bike to the rack.
2. Remove the helmet.
3. Put on a cap.
4. Attach the bib belt.
5. Recharge the nutrition in my pockets.
6. Keep the sunglasses and the running shoes and go!

### Run

1. Start slow and take one nutrition sachet.
2. Gradually increase the pace after 3k.
3. Take a nutrition sachet before every other water station.
4. Sprint as soon as I spot the finish line.
