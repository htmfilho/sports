## Pre-race

- First of all, I need to charge my Garmin watch.
- Run a 5k distance the day before to activate the gut. It reduces the chances of needing a washroom during the race.
- Pass the sunscreen in advance, so it has time to dry before putting on my racewear.
- Bring the tire's pump.
- Bring sandals to wear after dropping my shoes at the transition. The path to the swimming area might be hot or gravel.
- Fill my water bottle with a hydration drink.
- Ride the bike for a few minutes to check if everything is good to go or if something needs to be fixed.
- At the transition area:
  - Attach the bike to the rack.
  - Put the helmet on top of the bike seat to remind myself to put it on before getting the bike off the hack.
  - Organize the equipment below the bike, over a towel, separated by transitioning to bike and running.
- If allowed, wear a wet suit. It enables me to glide and float more, translating into more speed.
- Warm up my body with active dry-land before entering the water. It helps to resist the water temperature and allows me to sprint at the start.

## Swim

- Start the race sprinting for at least 200m to distance myself from the slow crowd. They produce waves that make breathing harder, affecting my cadence and technique.
- After finding some space, I focus more on stretching and good technique to glide more and save energy.
- If possible, find someone who looks reliable at swimming, at my pace, to track from behind and slightly to the side (draft is illegal). This way, I don't need to check for directions as often.
- Swim backstroke to turn left or right in the turning buoys. I also swim backstroke when tired to get access to all the air I need, and recover while efficiently moving forward.
- When the finish line is finally visible, sprint to it, using the remaining energy in your arms, which will not be demanded as much anymore.
- In the water, swimming is more efficient than walking, so try to swim until you can't stroke anymore, instead of walking when it's possible to reach the bottom.
- While running to the transition:
  - Remove the cap and the goggles.
  - If wearing a wet suit, remove it down to my waist and keep running to the bike with the legs covered.
  - Visualize myself doing the transition, going through all the steps in my head.

## Transition to Bike

- If wearing a wet suit, remove the remaining part.
- Wear the helmet and make sure it is well attached and tight.
- Put on the helmet.
- Put on the sunglasses.
- My bike doesn't clip the shoes, so I put socks on and running shoes instead. It will be slightly less efficient, but it makes the transition to running faster.
- Put the nutrition in my pockets.
- Remove the bike from the hack and run with it until passing the start line.

## Bike

- Mount the bike and go, but move slowly at the beginning.
- Eat two nutrition sachets, one to replenish from the swimming and another one for the distance ahead. Drink a quarter of the water bottle to dilute the nutrition, smoothing the digestion.
- Gradually increase the speed to a pace I can sustain for longer.
- Take a sip of water every time I feel my mouth dry.
- Take a nutrition sachet every 30 minutes, followed by water.
- If riding against the wind, lean my upper body as much as possible in an aero position.

## Transition to Run

- Attach the bike to the rack.
- Remove the helmet.
- Put on a cap.
- Attach the bib belt.
- Recharge the nutrition in my pockets.
- Keep the sunglasses and the running shoes and go!

## Run

- Start slow and take one nutrition sachet.
- Gradually increase the pace after 3k.
- Take a nutrition sachet before every other water station.
- Sprint as soon as I spot the finish line.
