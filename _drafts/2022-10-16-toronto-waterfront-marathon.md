It was like forgetting everything I knew about running. In other words, a failure. I was in my best running shape and form, no injures, all intervals and long runs done, and I didn't even get a personal best. But what happened?

My old [Garmin](https://www.garmin.com/en-CA/c/wearables-smartwatches/) watch broke and I got a new one. The new model came with a coaching feature. The watch is capable of guiding and monitoring my workouts, not like a real coach but quite close. I joined a free half-marathon program by [Jeff Galloway](https://www.jeffgalloway.com) and defined as goal a new personal best time for that distance. I followed the program and by 3/4 of it I overachieved my goal by 5 minutes! I'm not fully endorsing the program, since I practiced more than it required, but it helped to develop other running techniques. My new half-marathon personal best was less harder than I expected and it gave me too much confidence to risk a faster marathon.

Time: 04:08:42; Best Time: 04:23:24; 14:18 faster.
