## Stage 1: 10km at RIM Park, Waterloo

The first edition of the ENDURrun Sport 2023 started with a moderate 10 km on the Grand River Trail, in the surroundings of RIM Park. The course was a 5km loop, mostly flat, but with up hills at the end. The field started with 46 participants and everybody finished the first stage. I started slowly, one of the last ones in the pack. Most of the runners pushed strong from the beginning, which scared me at first, but as I warmed up, I got slowly faster and caught up with the others. I gained 6 positions and finished in 13th.

## Stage 2: 7.5km at Riverbluffs Park, Cambridge

The second stage was a time trial on the Grand River Trail, at Riverbluffs Park, Cambridge. The trail is scenic, it has many ups and downs, but it is not technical. Runners started the 7.5km distance one by one, 30 seconds from each other, with the slower starting first and the fastest starting last, based on the results of Stage 1. I was the 13th to start and passed all the previous runners, but I didn't gain any new positions. At this point, the gap between the 12th, the 14th, and I seemed to be enough to keep me safe in my current position.
