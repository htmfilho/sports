## Stage 1: Sunday, 10km at RIM Park, Waterloo

The first edition of the ENDURrun Sport 2023 started with a moderate 10 km on the Grand River Trail, in the surroundings of RIM Park. The course was a 5km loop, mostly flat, but with up hills at the end. The field started with 46 participants and everybody finished the first stage. I started slowly, one of the last ones in the pack. Most of the runners pushed strong from the beginning, which scared me at first, but as I warmed up, I got slowly faster and caught up with the others. I gained 6 positions and finished in 13th.

## Stage 2: Monday, 7.5km at Riverbluffs Park, Cambridge

The second stage was a time trial on the Grand River Trail, at Riverbluffs Park, Cambridge. The trail is scenic, it has many ups and downs, but it is not technical. Runners started the 7.5km distance one by one, 30 seconds from each other, with the slower starting first and the fastest starting last, based on the results of Stage 1. I was the 13th to start and passed all the previous runners, but I didn't gain any new positions. At this point, the gap between the 12th, the 14th, and I seemed to be enough to keep me safe in my current position.

## Stage 3: Tuesday, 5km at Shade's Mills Conservation Area, Cambridge

The third stage was pretty short but tough. We ran in a beautiful hilly trail, 20% technical, 30% grass, and the rest regular. The course is a 5km loop, 95% covered by trees. When running a shorter distance, runners tend to run faster, so I had to push through those hills to keep my overall position. That was tougher than expected, giving me chills about the next stage, which is running the same loop twice, around 30 minutes later.

## Stage 4: Tuesday, 10km at Shade's Mills Conservation Area, Cambridge

The only difference between Stage 3 and 4 was the distance. The course was the same. I felt like I was part of an experiment. Why didn't they merge stage 3 and stage 4 into a 15km distance, running the loop 3 times? Perhaps to burn or break our legs in a faster 5k to make the 10k look tougher. I don't know, but I felt better, stronger than during Stage 3. I slowed down a bit at the beginning, fearing the distance, but as the race went by, I felt good to run negative splits. Around 4km, I felt people bridging the gap behind me, but my negative splits desencoraged them. I ended up gaining 2 positions, finishing in 8th!

## Stage 5: Wednesday
