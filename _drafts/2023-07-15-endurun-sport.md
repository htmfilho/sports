## Stage 1: Sunday, 10km at RIM Park, Waterloo

The first edition of the ENDURrun Sport 2023 started with a moderate 10 km on the Grand River Trail, in the surroundings of RIM Park. The course was a 5km loop, mostly flat, but with up hills at the end. The field started with 46 participants and everybody finished the first stage. I started slowly, one of the last ones in the pack. Most of the runners pushed strong from the beginning, which scared me at first, but as I warmed up, I got slowly faster and caught up with the others. I gained 6 positions and finished in 13th.

## Stage 2: Monday, 7.5km at Riverbluffs Park, Cambridge

The second stage was a time trial on the Grand River Trail, at Riverbluffs Park, Cambridge. The trail is scenic, it has many ups and downs, but it is not technical. Runners started the 7.5km distance one by one, 30 seconds from each other, with the slower starting first and the fastest starting last, based on the results of Stage 1. I was the 13th to start and passed all the previous runners, but I didn't gain any new positions. At this point, the gap between the 12th, the 14th, and I seemed to be enough to keep me safe in my current position.

## Stage 3: Tuesday, 5km at Shade's Mills Conservation Area, Cambridge

The third stage was pretty short but tough. We ran on a beautiful hilly trail, 20% technical, 30% grass, and the rest regular. The course is a 5km loop, 95% covered by trees. When running a shorter distance, runners tend to run faster, so I had to push through those hills to keep my overall position. That was tougher than expected, giving me chills about the next stage, which is running the same loop twice, around 30 minutes later.

## Stage 4: Tuesday, 10km at Shade's Mills Conservation Area, Cambridge

The only difference between Stages 3 and 4 was the distance. The course was the same. I felt like I was part of an experiment. Why didn't they merge stage 3 and stage 4 into a 15km distance, running the loop 3 times? Perhaps to burn or break our legs in a faster 5k to make the 10k look tougher. I don't know, but I felt better, stronger than during Stage 3. I slowed down a bit at the beginning, fearing the distance, but as the race went by, I felt good to run negative splits. Around 4km, I felt people bridging the gap behind me, but my negative splits discouraged them. I ended up gaining 2 positions, finishing in 8th!

## Stage 5: Wednesday, 8km at Water Bean Trail, Kitchener

The fifth stage was tough. We ran a loop twice, on a pretty hilly trail along the Grand River. The trail is well-covered by trees and not technical at all, but part of it was closed for maintenance, forcing the organizers to adapt the course. I was optimistic after my Stage 4 performance, so I tried to closely follow faster runners, but soon the hills showed me my realistic place in the race. They were so steep that I got my heart rate up pretty quickly. The gap increased between me and the next runner to the point I had to change my strategy to simply maintain my position.

## Stage 6: Thursday, 13.4km at Baden Hills, Wilmot

Cancelled! Weather Canada has a history of overreacting to weather conditions, so everyone was skeptical when they announced a severe thunderstorm coming to the area. Runners, volunteers, and organizers headed to Baden Hills as planned, just to be surprised by the force of the storm, which left part of the group stuck under the tents and others in the parking lot. I was in the car and could barely see outside, given the density of the rain. I was afflicted in there, thinking if I could be of any help outside, but the fear of being hit by lightning was overwhelming. On my way home, I witnessed at least three lightning strikes on the ground, which confirmed my worries. I learned later, through the Facebook group, that everybody got safely at home. That's what matters now.

## Stage 7: Saturday

## Stage 8: Sunday
