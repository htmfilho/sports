It takes ten years of continuous practice to master something. In some school systems, 10 is the maximum score. Ten pull-ups are one of the requirements to join the Marine Corps. Many people, including me, read books ten pages at a time. I can go on and on with examples, but what matters is that it took me ten marathons to run the distance in under 4 hours. It happened in the Georgina Marathon 2023.

Every marathon taught me something about running, racing, body, and mind. I learned about hydration, nutrition, metabolism, biomechanics, injury treatment and prevention, and even mind control. For my 10th marathon, I wanted to put everything together to reach my goal. But I knew it was not enough. I also needed to stop drinking and strengthen my muscles. 

I thought my drinking was at a social level, but one day I collected all the empty bottles pilled in my garage and I had to do two car trips to return them. That was certainly more than a thousand dollars worth of alcohol. That was bad. But how to stop drinking with such a high social pressure around us? The solution I found worked really well: non-alcoholic beer. They look like beer, and taste like beer, but have little to no alcohol. I had the feeling of drinking without getting intoxicated. My leaver loved the idea! It had more metabolism to do other than alcohol. On the other front, I knew I had good slow oxidative fibers in my muscles, the ones that produce low-power contractions over long periods while slow to fatigue. However, those fibers are constantly under stress when they don't have the support of the fast contraction fibers. Enough strength training can sustain the contractions of slow fibers for longer, increasing endurance and minimizing injuries. But I'm not a big fan of weightlifting. The solution I found was to do a lot of hill-repeats, technical trail running, and introducing biking and swimming. The first one strengthens my legs as a whole, the second one strengthens my feet, and the third strengthens the rest of the body for proper posture.

Three months with those changes and I already felt a huge difference.
