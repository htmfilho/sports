The idea of doing a Triathlon never crossed my mind until the winter of 2023, when a friend approached me and asked, "Let's do an IronMan?!". I replied with the only answer I knew, "Yes!" barely knowing what it was about. The days that followed were all excitement, trying to learn everything about this triathlon format and how to prepare for it. The idea quickly propagated through my family, and everybody got hooked on it too. However, we needed to be patient because we were at least six months away from any triathlon activity. Fortunately, time passed quickly, and here I am, telling the story of my first triathlon.

## Swimming

Even if the open water swim has some visual signs that helps with orientation, trust the training and do a frontal view every 7 strokes. We swam in a facility that is also used for canoeing races. They installed cables under water to support the race lanes. I used those cables for orientation so I could focus on the swim. However, the cable suddenly disappeared and I continued swimming, hoping to find it again, but I went way off the course. I think I had to swim 25m more to correct the course. Everything else went well, even the messy start. One last note about the swimming is how mush speed you gain wearing a wet suit. At the start, while I was constantly moving to float, those with wet suits looked more relaxed. During the swim, many were fast, even without a proper swimming technique. So, I absolutely need to buy a wet suit.

# Biking

The transition to biking was good, but I made a mistake that worried me throughout the entire ride: I forgot to attach my bib number. I had it written with a Sharpee on my two arms, but it would be difficult to see while in movement. So, I was afraid of being dequalified. But the ride was awesome anyway! The course was flat, well-marked, and scenic, passing through Ontario's farmlands. I managed to sustain an average speed of ~32km/h, rolling 30km/h with headwind and 34km/h with tailwind. The best part was to surpass really expensive bikes with my 15 hundred entry-level road bike, without clip pedals. At the end of the day, the real engine is within our legs.

A decision that had a later impact was to bring a single water bottle. It was empty around the 30km mark and the water station was at the 40km mark. My mouth got dry during that 10km water intake gap. In the water station, I dropped my empty bottle and got a full one, but the one I dropped was a real bike bottle and the one I got was a simple water bottle. Next time, I will just bring a disposable Gatorade-like bottle. By the 50km mark, my butt and my balls were hurting a lot. To alleviate the pain, I had to stand for a few seconds before sitting again, but the pain was coming back 2 minutes later. It felt like my circulation was blocked by my seat and my blood flow resumed after standing up. I don't know what it was, but people have advised me to train more and see if it passes over time.

## Running

I was part of a relay so I had to push. Instead of starting slow and progressively speed up, I averaged 4:34/km in the first kilometer. I put myself close to my limit for the distance, to the point I bet my previous best performance by almost 3 minutes.

## Takeaways

1. I have to learn to balance my effort better across the modalities. Maybe the running would have been better if I had started slowly and improved the pace gradually. Unfortunately, I have to wait an entire year to race another long-course triathlon to test a new strategy.

2. I'm not ready to race a longer triathlon than this one yet. I feel good about my swimming, but I have to train cycling way more to deal with my sitting discomfort and improve my effort balance and race strategy. But could I finish a longer triathlon today? Of course! But not without suffering too much.

3. The experience was great, and I'm definitely into triathlon. It unites in a single event two of my favourite sports, swimming and running, despite the high cost of cycling.
